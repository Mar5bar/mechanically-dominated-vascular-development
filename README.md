A MATLAB implementation of an agent-based model of mechanically dominated vascular development.

-----------
Basic usage
-----------

Running main.m will run a sample simulation, save the output, and produce a plot of a grown network. All parameters for domain growth in an annulus can be set in the params structure within main.m. Helper functions for plotting can be found in the relevant subdirectory and are easily modified.

For full descriptions of the parameters and the context of the model, please refer to the included comments and the original publication (in preparation).
